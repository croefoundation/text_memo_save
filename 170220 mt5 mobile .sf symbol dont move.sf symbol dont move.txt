but only *.sf Quotes/Advanced tab have issues
that price is moving, High,Low=0.000 don't move

for example;
[Quotes/advanced tab] symbol price, High, Low

1)*.pf, *.cf, *.df  = all is ok
                      (price, High, Low / all is moving)
2)SuccessRoad-demo = all is ok
                      (price, High, Low / all is moving)

3)SuccessRoad-Live *.sf =  price is moving.
                      
                      but High=0.000, Low=0.000 / not moving)
