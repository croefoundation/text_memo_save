Open your image in Gimp
Make your canvas square
Resize your layer to the image
Scale the layer to the largest size in your .ico file like 64 pixels
Duplicate the layer
Scale the duplicate layer to the next size
Keep duplicating / scaling for all the sizes you want in your .ico file
Save as .ico



	
You can do this for free in GIMP. There are brief instructions for doing this here.

In your case, you could either start with the largest image and scale down for each duplicated image, or you could just add new layers and import the specific icon images you wanted into that layer.
