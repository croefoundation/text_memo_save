Hello 

 let me know how to set MT5(Arrange windows as a non-overlapping tiles(Alt-R)) like MT4 style

Our customet have used MT4, and we persuade them to use MT5. 

but they always claim to us after using MT5.



issue is following

pls.. let me know the way how to set like MT4 style "Arrange windows as a non-overlapping tiles(Alt-R)"

please chek. [attached files..]



MT4 ----------------  

(Before) chart sequence 1-2-3

1.EURUSD,M1  (BLACK) ->2.EURUSD,M5  (WHITE) ->3.EURUSD,M15 (BLUE)

after moving the chart sequence  3-2-1 or 2-3-1 ....

(After)

Click-->Arrange windows as a non-overlapping tiles(Alt-R)

then ->back intial position 1-2-3

1.EURUSD,M1  (BLACK) ->2.EURUSD,M5  (WHITE)->3.EURUSD,M15 (BLUE)


MT4 is always initial position back.. if click Alt-R, although we move the charts randoum position .

-------------------

but MT5 don't back its initial chart sequence but random position. Why?

MT5 ----------------  

(Before) chart sequence  1-2-3

1.EURUSD,M1  (BLACK) ->2.EURUSD,M5  (WHITE) ->3.EURUSD,M15 (BLUE)

after moving the chart sequence  3-2-1 or 2-3-1 ....

(After)

Click-->Arrange windows as a non-overlapping tiles(Alt-R)

then ->can not back intial position , that is random sequence like 2-3-1,

2.EURUSD,M5  (WHITE)->3.EURUSD,M15 (BLUE)-1.EURUSD,M1  (BLACK) 


MT5 is always random position back.. if click Alt-R,

the example is just 3ea charts. 

but our customer usually use 5 charts. M1,M5,M15,M30,MH1 and then trade.

they have been accustomed to this initial chart position setting   .

so it is inconvinent  for them to reset the chart sequence first state. 

so they want to set chart sequnce  like MT4 style.



let me know the way how to set like MT4.

thanks
