oh my God .Today I had same problem.
Main Account position remained.
but all of  slave account position was cleared suddenly.  Above issue was same a weeks ago.
This time i think maybe the reason is liveupdate in Metatrader5 build (1570-->1571)

1)Main account
  Login --> live update (popup)--->click -->log out -->build upgrade (1571)
  -->all position normal ok.

2)but all of slave account -->cleared

i attached journal file. (170403 --.txt)
please check fastcopy p/g. this is big problem.

--------------------
And i attached the above problem that happend a weeks ago 03.27 journal file..
it was the same problem.
main account positions are remained normally. 
(just group changed in manager terminal) but all of slave account positions are cleared.
why?
please..check for me
our customer protesting me...
