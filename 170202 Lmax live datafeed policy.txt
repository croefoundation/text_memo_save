Dear Mr. Kim,
 
With regard to commission and costs for receiving LMAX Exchange¡¯s liquidity by FIX API, please see below examples.
 
Broker Costs = $2,500 minimum monthly commission (3 months free).
               Example: per million commission = $15/Mio
A)     Your Company does No Trading, then pay minimum monthly commission of $2,500 total
B)     Your Company does 150 Mio ($15 * 150 = $2,250) then pay $250 [$2,250 + $250] = $2,500 total
C)     Your Company does 180 Mio ($15 * 180 = $2,700) then pay $0 extra [$2,700 + $0] = $2,700 total
D)     Your Company does 500 Mio ($15 * 500 = $7,500) then pay $0 extra [$7,000 + $0] = $7,000 total
 
Company that is NOT a Broker = minimum monthly VOLUME of 100 Million / Month OR pay $300
** This is NOT a minimum commission, but rather this is a minimum Volume. If the minimum volume is not done, the charge of $300 USD applies each month (first month Free, no charge))
 
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and Happy Lunar New Year to you and your family!
