Mr.phil..sir.
sorry for replying lately..
i have been busy for preparing meeting. we are going to held a seminar in Tokyo this weekend.
So, i want to discuss you more about our issue  next week..

According to what you said, 
I think that maybe contract or process with LMAX will take a long time.
Not broker, although as a company it is difficult for us to trade and receive feed, within a short period of time
(what other way?..as a person?  )

anyway if not,
we'll try to prepare for your requirements, step by step. 

pls.help me..
thanks.
