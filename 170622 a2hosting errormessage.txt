hi
i have trouble in connecting database .. pls help me..
<db account> 
 host: 209.124.66.5 (lidyahk.com)
user:  lidyahkc_0
pw : lidya2016
dbname: lidyahkc_lidya

i have used SQLyog program  instead of Cpanel Mysql admin  ..
but  i cannot connect  my db with SQLyog because of Login error.
error message is " Access denied. "  (attached .png)
i think maybe it is not allowed my ip 175.209.243.52  to connect a2hosting( ip.:209.124.66.5)
where can i set make ip  allowable?

SQLYOG prgram is properly worked.
because i have 2 account in A2hosting.com.  delight1.com  and lidyahkc.com
delight1.com  is connected with SqlYog program .. all is ok.  
but just  lidyahk.com is not connected....
what i should do.. 
please help me..
